        <p>Since its genesis in 1997, the pursuit of Quality and quest for excellence in education has always fuelled OPJMS into the frenzy of action to challenge the conventional teaching and learning practices and to establish itself as the vanguard of innovation and new developments in education. It is this spirit of innovations and ardent desire of OPJMS to push its own limits that has culminated in much-coveted National Education Excellence Award 2013 being conferred on OPJMS by ASSOCHAM, an Apex Chamber set up in 1920 for Trade and Industry.
 
            Discerning the need for great reforms in education to improve its quality and delivery and to enhance employability, ASSOCHAM has institutionalized/instituted award for Excellence in Education to be given for the best practices in six categories. Application for different categories of the award were invited from all the leading Schools across the nation and these were put through a rigorous screening by a panel of astute and eminent members of jury from diverse fields. 
             
            After successfully completing the screening, OPJMS that had applied for it was adjudged as the Best School in the category of K-12 Awards: Best use of technology in Teaching Learning practices. The prestigious award ceremony was held on 9th April 2013 in New Delhi and was being presided over by the honourable Union Minister, HRD, Govt. of India, Dr. M.M.

                    <p class="p_modal">Popularly known as O.P. Jindal, Shri Om Prakash Jindal was born on August 7, 1930 to a farmer Late Netram Jindal of village Nalwa of district Hisar in Haryana. Being a precocious child, the young Jindal has always displayed strong inclination for machines since his childhood. 
 
                        Actuated by his passion for machines, he began his industrial career with a small bucket-manufacturing unit in Hisar. The journey that began with a small bucket –manufacturing unit found its culmination in the establishment of a large industrial house under the name of Jindal Strips Limited in 1969. 
                         
                        Shri Jindal had envisioned a self-reliant India in every sector of industry. He visited several foreign countries to keep himself abreast with the latest industrial technical development and know-how. The knowledge thus acquired was aptly applied to accelerate production of his industrial establishments. His meticulous planning supplemented with well-conceived efforts eventually bore fruits as at present there are many factories under the flagship of the Jindal Organization which are worth over 16 Billion Dollars, under whose spectral umbrella thousands of families thrive.
                         
                        Sh. O.P. Jindal was the Chairman of the Jindal Organization. For his significant contribution to the Indian Steel Industry, he was bestowed upon with the prestigious "Life Time Achievement Award" by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry.
                         
                        Being an altruist in the true sense of the word, Shri O P Jindal found the purpose of his life in helping the common man in every possible way. The list of his philanthropic activities is rather endless. He was the Chairman of N.C. Jindal Charitable Trust, under whose auspices a 600 bed N.C. Jindal Institute of Medical Sciences functions in Hisar, Haryana. He understood well the role of education in uplifting the masses and its significant contribution in national progress in general and common man in particular. 
                         
                        So, he became the agent of change for the illiterate and uneducated populace of Hisar by establishing O P Jindal Modern School, a co-educational school from LKG to XII with a strength of 3800 students and a wing for specially abled children and 10+2 residential school by the name of Vidya Devi Jindal School, Hisar. <br></p>
